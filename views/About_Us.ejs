        <h1>About IdeaTech</h1>

        <p>Welcome to IdeaTech, your go-to platform for accessing manuals and resources for machines available in the
            Idea Lab!</p>

        <h2>Our Project</h2>

        <p>The IdeaTech project addresses a fundamental challenge faced by students and faculty members in the Idea Lab:
            accessing and managing manuals for the various machines available. In a dynamic environment where innovation
            is key, having easy access to accurate and up-to-date information is essential.</p>
        <p>Our platform serves as a centralized hub for all machine manuals in the Idea Lab, including those for the CO2
            laser cutting machine, 3D printer, and PCB machine. By consolidating these resources into one accessible
            location, we aim to streamline operations and enhance productivity.</p>
        <p>With IdeaTech, users can upload, access, and view manuals with ease. The integration of the EJS template
            ensures a seamless and user-friendly experience, allowing users to find the information they need quickly
            and efficiently.</p>
        <p>Moreover, IdeaTech goes beyond manual management. It facilitates communication and collaboration among users,
            enabling students to request machine availability from the admin and teachers to organize workshops for
            specific machines. This collaborative approach fosters a supportive learning environment and encourages
            hands-on experimentation and exploration.</p>
        <p>Overall, IdeaTech is more than just a platform for managing machine manuals. It's a catalyst for innovation
            and creativity in the Idea Lab, empowering users to turn their ideas into reality and make meaningful
            contributions to the world of technology and design.</p>

        <h2>Key Functionality</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Student Requests:</strong> Students can submit requests to the admin to check the availability
                of machines in the Idea Lab. The admin can then confirm availability and provide timings for access.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Teacher Workshops:</strong> Teachers have the ability to send emails to students, organizing
                workshops for various machines available in the Idea Lab. This feature promotes collaboration and
                hands-on learning.</li>
            <li><strong>User Authentication:</strong> Our platform supports three types of logins: admin, teacher, and
                student. Each login type has specific privileges and functionalities tailored to their role in the Idea
                Lab.</li>
            <li><strong>Login and Signup System:</strong> We've implemented a robust login and signup system, ensuring
                authentication using official IDs provided by the college for both teachers and admins. This enhances
                security and accountability within the platform.</li>
        </ul>
